# Virtual Tenors

## Description
Real-life tenor drums are expensive and hard-to-store instruments. This changes that: you can now have a virtual set
of tenor drums on your PC! This tenor set is a set of quints (1 spock drum) with a cowbell. 

## Installation
### bash/zsh: 
Run `git clone https://github.com/EthanTock/virtual_tenors.git <directory>`, where `<directory>` is the directory you 
want to clone this repository into.
